## 📅 30-Day Content Calendar

### Week 1: Problem Awareness (Days 1-7)

**Goal:** Establish the problem and build anticipation

#### Day 1 - Monday, 9:00 AM

**Tweet:**
```
I spent 6 hours yesterday refactoring code from @magicpath_ai

The UI looked perfect.
The code was a disaster.

Hardcoded values everywhere. Zero error handling. No accessibility.

AI tools are amazing for speed, but the code quality? 😬

Anyone else dealing with this?
```

**Why this works:** Starts with a relatable pain point, tags the competitor (visibility), asks a question (engagement).

#### Day 1 - Monday, 7:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Real talk: AI design tools have changed how I build.

I can prototype in minutes instead of hours.

But I'm spending MORE time on code quality than before.

The trade-off isn't worth it... yet.

What if we could get both speed AND quality? 🤔
```

**Why this works:** Balanced perspective (not just complaining), hints at a solution, creates curiosity.

#### Day 2 - Tuesday, 1:00 PM

**Tweet (with screenshot):**
```
This is actual code generated by an AI design tool:

[Screenshot of messy code with issues highlighted]

• var instead of const
• No error handling
• Hardcoded API endpoint
• Missing types
• Inline styles
• No loading state

Would you ship this to production? 😅
```

**Why this works:** Visual proof of the problem, specific examples, rhetorical question drives engagement.

#### Day 3 - Wednesday, 9:00 AM

**Tweet:**
```
I analyzed 100 components from AI design tools.

Average code quality score: 52/100

Common issues:
• 89% missing error handling
• 76% have hardcoded values
• 68% lack accessibility
• 54% have security issues
• 43% missing TypeScript types

The pattern is clear. We need a solution.
```

**Why this works:** Data-driven (builds credibility), specific percentages (shareable), teases solution.

#### Day 4 - Thursday, 7:00 PM

**Thread:**
```
🧵 The hidden cost of AI-generated code

I tracked my time for a week. Here's what I found:

1/7
```

```
AI tools saved me 12 hours on UI development.

But I spent 18 hours fixing the code they generated.

Net result: -6 hours

I was SLOWER than coding from scratch.

2/7
```

```
The issues were consistent:

• Refactoring hardcoded values → 4 hours
• Adding error handling → 3 hours
• Implementing accessibility → 3 hours
• Adding TypeScript types → 2 hours
• Security fixes → 2 hours
• Writing tests → 4 hours

3/7
```

```
At $100/hour (conservative for dev work), that's:

$1,800 in refactoring costs

For code that was "free" from an AI tool.

The math doesn't math.

4/7
```

```
The worst part?

I'm making the SAME fixes every time.

Same patterns. Same issues. Same refactoring.

It's completely automatable.

5/7
```

```
So I'm building something to fix this.

A tool that automatically refactors AI-generated code.

Proper error handling. TypeScript types. Accessibility. Security.

Production-ready code in 60 seconds.

6/7
```

```
Launching in 2 weeks.

Want early access?

Drop a 👋 below and I'll DM you when it's ready.

(Also, RT if you've felt this pain)

7/7
```

**Why this works:** Threads perform well, data-driven story, clear problem → solution arc, call-to-action.

#### Day 5 - Friday, 1:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Hot take:

AI design tools aren't the problem.

The problem is expecting AI to write production-ready code on the first try.

We need a second AI to fix the first AI's code.

AI inception. 🤯

(This is actually what I'm building)
```

**Why this works:** Controversial take (engagement), humor, meta-commentary, hints at solution.

#### Day 6 - Saturday, 10:00 AM

**Tweet (with before/after image):**
```
Same component.

Before: AI-generated
After: Production-ready

Spot the differences:

[Side-by-side code comparison image]

This is what I'm automating.

Launching soon.
```

**Why this works:** Visual comparison (highly shareable), concrete example, builds anticipation.

#### Day 7 - Sunday, 7:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Week 1 of building in public: ✅

What I learned:

• 200+ devs have the same AI code quality problem
• Average time spent refactoring: 2-4 hours per component
• Most common issue: missing error handling (89%)
• People want this solved YESTERDAY

Week 2: Building the solution.

Follow along 👇
```

**Why this works:** Recap builds narrative, data from engagement, teases next phase, CTA to follow.

---

### Week 2: Building in Public (Days 8-14)

**Goal:** Show progress, build credibility, grow audience

#### Day 8 - Monday, 9:00 AM

**Tweet:**
```
Starting Week 2 of building CodePolish.

Today's goal: Ship the core refactoring engine.

Input: Messy AI code
Output: Production-ready code

Let's see if I can do it in 8 hours.

Will report back tonight. 🚀
```

**Why this works:** Sets clear goal, creates accountability, promises update (keeps followers engaged).

#### Day 8 - Monday, 9:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Update: Took 11 hours, not 8.

But it works. 🎉

Just refactored a component from @v0 in 60 seconds.

Quality score went from 48 → 91.

The AI added:
• Error boundaries
• TypeScript types
• Loading states
• ARIA labels
• Try-catch blocks

This is going to save SO much time.
```

**Why this works:** Honest about challenges, shows results, specific metrics, tags competitor for visibility.

#### Day 9 - Tuesday, 1:00 PM

**Tweet (with video/GIF):**
```
First look at CodePolish in action:

[30-second screen recording of polishing code]

Paste code → Click polish → Get production-ready code

60 seconds. No manual refactoring.

Launching on Product Hunt in 5 days.

Thoughts?
```

**Why this works:** First demo (builds excitement), visual proof, countdown creates urgency, asks for feedback.

#### Day 10 - Wednesday, 9:00 AM

**Thread:**
```
🧵 How CodePolish works under the hood

(Technical deep-dive for the curious)

1/6
```

```
Step 1: Code Analysis

CodePolish parses your code into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

It identifies:
• Component structure
• Props and state
• Side effects
• Event handlers
• Styling approach

2/6
```

```
Step 2: Issue Detection

Using pattern matching + AI, it finds:
• Hardcoded values
• Missing error handling
• Accessibility gaps
• Security vulnerabilities
• Performance anti-patterns

Each issue gets a severity score.

3/6
```

```
Step 3: Refactoring

For each issue, CodePolish applies framework-specific fixes:

React: Error boundaries, memo, lazy loading
Vue: Composables, computed, watchers
Svelte: Reactive statements, stores

It understands the context.

4/6
```

```
Step 4: Type Generation

If your code isn't TypeScript, CodePolish:
• Infers types from usage
• Generates interfaces
• Adds type annotations
• Ensures type safety

All while preserving your logic.

5/6
```

```
Step 5: Quality Scoring

Before/after analysis:
• Code complexity
• Test coverage potential
• Accessibility score
• Security rating
• Performance metrics

You see exactly what improved.

6/6
```

**Why this works:** Technical audience appreciates depth, builds credibility, shareable for tech-focused followers.

#### Day 11 - Thursday, 7:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Just added test generation to CodePolish.

It now writes component tests automatically:
• Render tests
• Prop validation
• Event handler tests
• Edge case coverage

Example:

[Screenshot of generated test code]

Shipping this feature on launch day.
```

**Why this works:** Feature announcement, shows continuous improvement, visual example, builds feature set.

#### Day 12 - Friday, 1:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Interesting data from beta testing:

Average quality score improvement: +43 points

Top improvements:
1. Error handling: +18 pts
2. TypeScript types: +12 pts
3. Accessibility: +8 pts
4. Security: +5 pts

Time saved per component: 2.3 hours

At $100/hour, that's $230 saved per polish.

ROI is insane.
```

**Why this works:** Data-driven, shows clear value, calculates ROI (helps justify price), builds social proof.

#### Day 13 - Saturday, 10:00 AM

**Tweet:**
```
CodePolish pricing is live:

🆓 Free: 5 polishes/month
💎 Pro: $19/mo for 100 polishes
👥 Team: $49/mo for 500 polishes

Honest question:

Is $19/mo too cheap if it saves 2+ hours per polish?

Should I charge more? 🤔
```

**Why this works:** Transparency builds trust, asking for pricing feedback (engagement), anchors value (2+ hours saved).

#### Day 14 - Sunday, 7:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Week 2 complete. 🎉

What shipped:
✅ Core refactoring engine
✅ Quality scoring
✅ Test generation
✅ Multi-framework support
✅ Pricing page

What's left:
• Polish the polish (meta)
• Record demo video
• Write launch copy

Launching Tuesday on @ProductHunt

Getting real now. 😅
```

**Why this works:** Progress update, shows momentum, sets launch date, vulnerability creates connection.

---

### Week 3: Launch Week (Days 15-21)

**Goal:** Drive Product Hunt launch, maximize visibility, convert traffic

#### Day 15 - Monday, 9:00 AM

#### Day 17 - Wednesday, 9:00 AM

**Tweet:**
```
Post-launch clarity:

Yesterday we got 850 signups.

Today I'm responding to 120+ pieces of feedback.

The most requested features:
1. GitHub integration (40%)
2. VS Code extension (25%)
3. Custom refactoring rules (20%)
4. Bulk polishing (15%)

Which should I build first?
```

**Why this works:** Transparency, shows you're listening, asks for input (engagement), prioritizes community.

#### Day 18 - Thursday, 1:00 PM

**Thread:**
```
🧵 What I learned launching on Product Hunt

(For anyone planning a launch)

1/10
```

```
Lesson 1: The first hour matters MOST

We got 50 upvotes in the first hour.

That early momentum pushed us into the top 5.

Top 5 = more visibility = more upvotes = higher ranking.

It's a flywheel.

Prepare your supporters before launch.

2/10
```

```
Lesson 2: Engagement > Upvotes

We responded to every single comment within 30 minutes.

This drove more discussion, which drove more visibility.

Product Hunt rewards engagement, not just upvotes.

Be present. Be helpful. Be genuine.

3/10
```

```
Lesson 3: Demo video is CRITICAL

80% of people watched our demo video.

Only 40% read the full description.

Video converts better than text.

Make it short (60 seconds), clear, and compelling.

4/10
```

```
Lesson 4: Pricing transparency wins

We showed pricing upfront. No "contact sales."

People appreciated the honesty.

Free tier lowered the barrier to try.

Clear pricing → higher conversion.

5/10
```

```
Lesson 5: Build in public before launch

We spent 2 weeks sharing our journey on Twitter.

This built an audience who was invested in our success.

They showed up on launch day.

Launch day isn't day 1. It's the culmination.

6/10
```

```
Lesson 6: Solve a REAL problem

CodePolish works because developers actually have this problem.

We didn't create demand. We captured existing frustration.

Find the pain. Build the solution.

7/10
```

```
Lesson 7: Competitors aren't enemies

We tagged @magicpath_ai and @v0 in our tweets.

Some people thought we were crazy.

But it worked. Their users found us.

Solve problems for competitor users.

8/10
```

```
Lesson 8: Free tier drives paid conversions

850 signups, 12 paid conversions (1.4%)

Most won't convert immediately.

But they'll try it, see value, and upgrade later.

Free tier is marketing, not charity.

9/10
```

```
Lesson 9: Launch is just the beginning

Day 1: 850 signups
Day 2: 120 more signups
Day 3: 80 more signups

The launch spike fades fast.

You need a growth strategy AFTER launch.

Content, SEO, partnerships, etc.

10/10
```

```
Lesson 10: Enjoy the moment

I was so focused on metrics that I almost forgot to celebrate.

Take a moment to appreciate what you built.

You shipped. That's huge.

Celebrate, then get back to work.

🎉
```

**Why this works:** Valuable insights (highly shareable), positions you as expert, helps others (builds goodwill), long thread (high engagement).

#### Day 19 - Friday, 7:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
First user testimonial just came in:

"CodePolish saved me 4 hours today. I polished 8 components from v0 and every single one came out production-ready. This tool is insane."

This is why we build. 🙏

Try it free: codepolish.app
```

**Why this works:** Social proof, specific results, emotional payoff, CTA.

#### Day 20 - Saturday, 10:00 AM

**Tweet:**
```
Weekend project idea:

Build something with @v0, @magicpath_ai, or @lovabledev

Then polish it with CodePolish

You'll get:
• Speed of AI generation
• Quality of hand-written code

Best of both worlds.

Who's trying this? 🙋
```

**Why this works:** Actionable suggestion, positions as complement not competitor, weekend timing (people have time), asks for participation.

#### Day 21 - Sunday, 7:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Week 3 recap:

🚀 Launched on Product Hunt (#2 product)
📈 1,050+ total signups
💰 18 paid conversions ($342 MRR)
⭐ 50+ GitHub stars
📧 Featured in 3 newsletters

Week 4 plan:

### Week 4: Post-Launch Growth (Days 22-30)

**Goal:** Sustain momentum, drive organic growth, build community

#### Day 22 - Monday, 9:00 AM

**Tweet:**
```
Most requested feature is shipping today:

GitHub Integration 🎉

Now you can:
• Polish code directly from GitHub

```

**Why this works:** Delivers on promise, shows you listen, new feature = new content, beta access creates exclusivity.

#### Day 23 - Tuesday, 1:00 PM

**Tweet (with comparison graphic):**
```
AI tool code quality comparison:

MagicPath: 52/100
v0: 58/100
Lovable: 55/100

After CodePolish: 90+ average

The tool doesn't matter if you polish the output.

Use any AI tool you want. We'll make it production-ready.
```

**Why this works:** Data comparison (shareable), positions as universal solution, non-threatening to competitors.

#### Day 24 - Wednesday, 9:00 AM

**Thread:**
```
🧵 5 code smells AI tools always produce

(And how CodePolish fixes them)

1/6
```

```
1. Hardcoded values

AI loves to hardcode:
• API endpoints
• Colors
• Sizes
• Text content

CodePolish extracts these to constants or config files.

Before:
fetch('https://api.example.com/users')

After:
fetch(API_ENDPOINTS.users)

2/6
```

```
2. Missing error handling

AI assumes the happy path.

No try-catch. No error states. No fallbacks.

CodePolish adds:
• Error boundaries
• Try-catch blocks
• Error state UI
• Fallback content

Production apps need this.

3/6
```

```
3. Inline styles

AI generates inline styles everywhere:

style={{padding: '20px', color: '#333'}}

CodePolish moves these to:
• CSS modules
• Tailwind classes
• Styled components

Whatever your project uses.

4/6
```

```
4. No accessibility

AI forgets:
• ARIA labels
• Keyboard navigation
• Focus management
• Screen reader support

CodePolish adds all of this automatically.

Accessibility isn't optional.

5/6
```

```
5. Missing TypeScript types

Even when you ask for TypeScript, AI often generates:

any, any, any everywhere

CodePolish infers proper types:
• Interface definitions
• Generic constraints
• Type guards
• Utility types

6/6
```

**Why this works:** Educational content (valuable), shows expertise, demonstrates features, shareable tips.

#### Day 25 - Thursday, 7:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Controversial opinion:

AI code generators are training wheels.

Eventually you won't need them.

But right now? They're incredibly useful.

And CodePolish is the helmet that keeps you safe while you learn.

🚴‍♂️ → 🏍️
```

**Why this works:** Controversial take (engagement), analogy (memorable), positions product smartly.

#### Day 26 - Friday, 1:00 PM

**Tweet:**
```
Just hit $500 MRR 🎉

30 Pro users
5 Team users

Revenue breakdown:
• Product Hunt: 40%
• Twitter: 30%
• Word of mouth: 20%
• Other: 10%

Next goal: $1K MRR by end of month

Building in public works.
```

**Why this works:** Milestone celebration, transparent metrics (inspires others), shows channel breakdown (helpful), sets next goal.

#### Day 27 - Saturday, 10:00 AM

**Tweet (with before/after):**
```
Saturday code review:

```

---

## 📈 Growth Tactics

### Tactic 1: Tag Competitors

Tag AI tool companies in your tweets (respectfully). Their users are your target audience.

**Example:**
```
Just polished 10 components from @v0 with CodePolish.

Every single one went from ~50 quality score to 90+.

v0 is amazing for speed. CodePolish makes it production-ready.

Best combo.
```

**Why this works:** Non-threatening, positions as complement, reaches their audience.

### Tactic 2: Engage with Relevant Conversations

Search for tweets about:
- "AI generated code"
- "MagicPath"
- "v0 code quality"
- "refactoring"

Reply with helpful insights (not just your product link).

**Example:**
```
Original tweet: "Spent 3 hours fixing code from MagicPath today 😭"

Your reply: "I feel this. I was spending 40% of my time refactoring AI code. Built a tool to automate it. Happy to share if interested!"
```

### Tactic 3: Create Shareable Graphics

Use tools like Canva to create:
- Before/after code comparisons
- Quality score improvements
- Feature comparison charts
- Tips and tricks graphics

Visual content gets 3x more engagement.

### Tactic 4: Run Polls

Polls drive massive engagement:

**Example:**
```
Which AI code generator do you use most?

🔵 MagicPath
🟢 v0 by Vercel
🟡 Lovable
🔴 Other (reply below)
```

Then reply to everyone who votes with helpful content.

### Tactic 5: Share User Wins

Retweet and quote tweet users who share their results:

**Example:**
```
RT @user: "Just tried @codepolish and it saved me 2 hours on a single component. This is insane."

Your QT: "This is why we build. 🙏 Thanks for trying it!"
```

### Tactic 6: Weekly Recap Threads

Every Sunday, share a recap thread:

**Example:**
```
Week X recap:

📈 [Metric 1]
🎉 [Milestone]
✅ [Feature shipped]
💡 [Lesson learned]

Next week: [Goals]

Follow along 👇
```

### Tactic 7: Ask for Feedback

People love giving opinions:

**Example:**
```
