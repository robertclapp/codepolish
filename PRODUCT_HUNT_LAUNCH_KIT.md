## 📅 Launch Timeline

### 2 Weeks Before Launch

**Build anticipation and gather support:**

You should start building momentum on Twitter and other platforms to ensure you have supporters ready to upvote on launch day. Product Hunt rewards early engagement, so having people ready to upvote in the first hour is critical.

**Actions:**
- Create Product Hunt profile if you don't have one
- Join Product Hunt community and engage with other launches
- Connect with 20+ "hunters" (people who frequently launch products)
- Prepare all launch assets (screenshots, videos, copy)
- Build email list of supporters
- Announce launch date on Twitter

### 1 Week Before Launch

**Final preparations:**

This is when you finalize all your materials and do a dry run to ensure everything is perfect. You only get one shot at Product Hunt, so preparation is key.

**Actions:**
- Finalize product description and tagline

- Take high-quality screenshots
- Write first comment (crucial for engagement)
- Prepare responses to common questions
- Schedule social media posts
- Email your list about upcoming launch

### Launch Day (Tuesday-Thursday recommended)

- **End of day**: Thank supporters and share results

### Post-Launch (Days 2-7)

**Maintain momentum:**

Even after the 24-hour launch window, you can continue to drive traffic and signups. Many users discover products days after the initial launch through Product Hunt's weekly newsletters and collections.

**Actions:**
- Share launch results on social media
- Thank everyone who supported
- Collect and implement feedback
- Continue engaging with comments
- Reach out to Product Hunt curators for featuring

## 💬 First Comment (Critical!)

Your first comment appears directly below your product listing and is often the first thing people read after the description. Use it to provide additional context, answer common questions, and drive engagement.

**First Comment Template:**

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to share CodePolish with you today!

**The Problem:**

Like many developers, I've been using AI design tools like MagicPath, v0, and Lovable to speed up development. They're amazing for generating UIs quickly, but there's a catch: the code quality is... not great.

I found myself spending 40% of my dev time refactoring AI-generated code. Hardcoded values, missing error handling, no accessibility, security issues—the list goes on. What should take 5 minutes to generate was taking 2-3 hours to make production-ready.

**The Solution:**

CodePolish automates this refactoring process. Just paste your AI-generated code, click "Polish," and get production-ready code in 60 seconds.

**What it does:**
✅ Adds proper error handling and loading states
✅ Converts to TypeScript with full type safety
✅ Fixes accessibility issues (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
✅ Hardens security (XSS prevention, input validation)
✅ Optimizes performance (memoization, lazy loading)
✅ Generates component tests
✅ Follows framework best practices

**How it works:**

CodePolish uses advanced AI to analyze your code, identify issues, and apply industry best practices. It understands React, Vue, and Svelte, and provides a detailed breakdown of every improvement made.

**Pricing:**

- **Free**: 5 polishes/month (perfect for side projects)
- **Pro**: $19/month for 100 polishes (for serious developers)
- **Team**: $49/month for 500 polishes (for small teams)

**Try it now:** [your-domain.com]

**I'd love your feedback!** What features would make this more useful for your workflow?

Thanks for checking it out! 🚀
```

**Why this works:**
- Starts with a personal story (builds connection)
- Clearly explains the problem (creates empathy)
- Shows the solution with specific benefits
- Includes pricing transparency
- Ends with a question (drives engagement)
- Uses emojis sparingly (adds personality without being unprofessional)

## 📱 Social Media Coordination

Launch on Product Hunt and social media simultaneously for maximum impact.

### Twitter Launch Thread

Post this thread at 12:10 AM PST (10 minutes after Product Hunt submission):

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
I spent 6 hours yesterday fixing AI-generated code from @magicpath_ai

The UI looked perfect. The code was a disaster.

So I built CodePolish - turns messy AI code into production-ready magic in 60 seconds ⚡

Just launched on @ProductHunt 👇

[Link to Product Hunt]
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
AI design tools are amazing for speed:
• Beautiful UIs in minutes
• No design skills needed
• Instant prototypes

But the code they generate?
• Hardcoded values everywhere
• Zero error handling
• Missing accessibility
• Security vulnerabilities
• No tests

You can't ship this to production.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
CodePolish fixes all of this automatically:

✅ Proper error handling
✅ TypeScript types
✅ Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav)
✅ Security hardening
✅ Performance optimization
✅ Component tests

Quality score: 45 → 92 in 60 seconds

[Before/after screenshot]
```

**Tweet 4 (How it Works):**
```
How it works:

1. Paste your AI-generated code
2. Select framework (React/Vue/Svelte)
3. Click "Polish Code"
4. Get production-ready code

The AI analyzes your code, identifies issues, and refactors following best practices.

See the difference:

### LinkedIn Post

Post this on LinkedIn at 8 AM PST on launch day:

```
🚀 Launching CodePolish on Product Hunt today!

After spending countless hours refactoring AI-generated code, I built a tool that automates the entire process.

The Challenge:
AI design tools like MagicPath and v0 are incredible for rapid prototyping, but the code they generate isn't production-ready. Our team was spending 40% of development time fixing:
• Hardcoded values
• Missing error handling
• Accessibility issues
• Security vulnerabilities
• Performance problems

The Solution:
CodePolish uses AI to automatically refactor AI-generated code, applying enterprise-grade best practices in 60 seconds.

Results:
• 60-second turnaround time
• +47 point average quality improvement
• 2.5 hours saved per component
• $15K/month in dev time savings for our team

Now available with a free tier at [your-domain.com]

If you're building with AI tools, I'd love your feedback!

### Reddit Strategy

**Do NOT post immediately on launch day.** Reddit is sensitive to self-promotion. Instead:

**Day 2-3 after launch:**
Post in r/SideProject with this format:

```
Title: "I built CodePolish to fix messy AI-generated code (launched on PH yesterday)"

Body:
Like many of you, I've been using AI code generators (MagicPath, v0, Lovable) to speed up development.

The UIs look great, but the code quality is... rough.

After spending way too much time refactoring, I built CodePolish.

**What it does:**
Automatically refactors AI-generated code, adding:
- Proper error handling
- TypeScript types
- Accessibility features
- Security hardening
- Performance optimizations
- Component tests

**How it works:**
1. Paste your code
2. Click "Polish"
3. Get production-ready code in 60 seconds

[Before/After Screenshot]

**Pricing:**
- Free: 5 polishes/month
- Pro: $19/month for 100 polishes

Built this as a solo dev over 3 weeks. Launched on Product Hunt yesterday and got [X] upvotes!

Would love your feedback: [your-domain.com]

**Tech stack:** React, tRPC, Drizzle ORM, Stripe, OpenAI

Happy to answer any questions about the build process or the tool itself!
```

**Post in r/webdev 1 week after launch:**

```
Title: "Show r/webdev: Tool to automatically refactor AI-generated code"

Body:
I built a tool that fixes the code quality issues in AI-generated components.

**Background:**
I've been using AI design tools for rapid prototyping, but the code always needs significant refactoring before shipping. This tool automates that process.

**Features:**
- Analyzes code quality (gives a score 0-100)
- Identifies specific issues
- Refactors following best practices
- Supports React, Vue, Svelte
- Generates tests

**Example:**
[Before/After comparison showing specific improvements]

**Free tier available:** [your-domain.com]

Built with React + tRPC + OpenAI. Open to feedback and questions!
